Case Study:** University Events Portal - MERN Stack Implementation
**
**Project Overview**

The University Events Portal is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline the organization, management, and participation in campus events. The system enables students to register, customize their preferences, and receive notifications for relevant events. Additionally, it empowers student committees to organize events, manage registrations, collect participation fees, and distribute rewards seamlessly.
By leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack, the portal provides a scalable, user-friendly, and responsive experience for students and event organizers. The platform ensures smooth event execution, enhances student engagement, and simplifies administrative processes.
